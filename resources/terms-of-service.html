<h2>User Content</h2>
<p>
When using eddy, eddy sends information about its input, its suggestions, and any user action taken in response to suggestions ("Usage Data") to our servers. Usage Data includes the fragment of source code that the user is working on ("Code Fragments"). Eddy Systems stores Usage Data, including Code Fragments, and processes them in order to improve eddy. Code Fragments that you write remain yours. In particular, you retain all intellectual property rights that you hold to your Code Fragments. By creating your Code Fragments using eddy, or while using eddy, you grant Eddy Systems a transferable worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate, publish, publicly perform or display, and distribute your Code Fragments without attribution. This license survives even after you stop using the Service. The rights you grant in this foregoing license are for the purpose of operating and improving eddy or other services created by Eddy Systems. 
</p><p>
 You represent and warrant that your Code Fragments, and our authorized use thereof, do not and will not infringe the rights of any third party (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights, rights of privacy or publicity, or any other legal or moral rights).
</p><p>
You acknowledge that Eddy Systems uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary payment processing, hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. Eddy Systems may charge for some aspects of the Service. In no event will you be charged for access to or use of any aspect of the Service, or to the Service as a whole, unless Eddy Systems obtains your prior agreement to pay such fees. The prices for any such features are subject to change at any time, without notice, at Eddy Systems's sole discretion.
</p><p>
The terms and conditions related to privacy and protection of your personal information are governed by the Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy"), which you can access at <a href="https://eddy.systems/privacy">https://eddy.systems/privacy</a>. You confirm that you have read and accept the Privacy Policy.

<h2>Liability for our Services  </h2>
<p>
YOU AGREE TO USE THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE, NEITHER EDDY SYSTEMS NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR PARTNERS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICE, OR ITS RELIABILITY OR AVAILABILITY. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE "AS IS".  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM EDDY SYSTEMS OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY FROM EDDY SYSTEMS NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EDDY SYSTEMS AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
</p><p>
  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF EDDY SYSTEMS AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS FOR ANY CLAIMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICE. EDDY SYSTEMS MAY DECIDE TO SUPPLY THE SERVICE AGAIN TO FULFILL A WARRANTY OR CLAIM INSTEAD OF REFUNDING A PAYMENT. 
</p><p>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent that Eddy Systems may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Eddy Systems’ liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.

<h2>About these Terms of Service  </h2>
<p>
The Terms of Service govern the relationship between Eddy Systems and you only. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.   If you do not comply with these terms, and Eddy Systems does not immediately take action, this does not mean that we are waiving any rights that we may have (such as terminating your access to the Service, or taking legal action).   If any particular term in these Terms of Service is not enforceable or otherwise invalid, this will not affect any other terms, and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.  The laws of California, USA will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to the Service or these Terms of Service. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, USA, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.   Questions about these Terms of Service should be sent to <a href="mailto:info@eddy.systems">info@eddy.systems</a>.
