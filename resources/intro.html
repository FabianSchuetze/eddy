<h1>Thanks for installing eddy!</h1>

  If eddy isn't sure what you meant, it'll show you options.

<H1>Logging Preferences</H1>
<p>
  eddy is a learning system and we would like to collect usage statistics in order to improve it. If you choose to allow
  logging, the information is anonymous. If you allow code logging, the logged information includes the line of code eddy
  saw and what it proposed. If you don't allow code logging, the logs will only contain when eddy showed hints, and when
  they were accepted, as well as error reports. You can always change your selection in the preference dialog.
  Please see our <a href="https://eddy.systems/privacy">privacy policy</a> for details.
