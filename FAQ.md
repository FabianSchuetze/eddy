### Why is eddy messing up my indentation?

Eddy inserts its fixes using IntelliJ's formatting settings, so if you are
seeing bad formatting it is likely that IntelliJ is incorrectly configured.
The settings can be adjusted in IntelliJ via `Preferences / Code Style / Java`. 
Note that changes made to the settings only take effects after a restart.
